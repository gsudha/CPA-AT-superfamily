# CPA-AT-superfamily
CPA/AT superfamily

representative_seq/
Representative sequence of each family.

Family_MSA/
MSA for each family. The input is the representative sequence. The MSA is generated by HHblits program using Uniclust30_2018_08 database. The default parameters are used.

Topology_representative_seq/
Final topology for representative sequence from each family. Files are labelled *.dtopo and *.rtopo for broken and reentrant transporters respectively. 

Homology_models/
Homology modelling based on the best structural template. The pir and pdb file for the homology model is provided. The homology model is generated using modeller 9.22.

Seed_MSA/
seed MSA for each family. The seed MSA is used for topology annotation and is also used to find the representative sequence.
